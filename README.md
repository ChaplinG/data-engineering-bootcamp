This repository contains scripts and resources from/for the Data Engineering Bootcamp, by Fernando Amaral, that simulates a real-world scenario with a "live" database generating sales in real-time.

In this bootcamp the goal was to build a Data Warehouse for a fictional car manufacturer. Through practical activities we used tools (such as SQL, AirFlow and others) to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, culminating in a dashboard for data visualization.
The course has been successfully completed, covering the following sections:
1. Intro
2. Database Exploration
3. Airflow setup on AWS with EC2 and Ubuntu
4. Snowflake Structure
5. Creating a DAG and loading data into the Stage area
6. Data transformation with dbt and analytical layer construction
7. Dashboard creation and evaluation of project alternatives
8. Closing lesson: Gratitude and next steps
