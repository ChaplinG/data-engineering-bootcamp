This repository contains scripts and resources from/for the Data Engineering Bootcamp, by Fernando Amaral, that simulates a real-world scenario with a "live" database generating sales in real-time.

In this bootcamp the goal is to build a Data Warehouse for a fictional car manufacturer. Through practical activities we use tools (such as SQL, AirFlow and others) to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, culminating in a dashboard for data visualization. Currently I completed the sections:
1. Intro
2. Database Exploration
3. Airflow setup on AWS with EC2 and Ubuntu
4. Snowflake Structure


Tools and Technologies
- SQL and python
- PostgreSQL, Airflow, Snowflake, dbt, Looker Studio
- Airflow Incremental Load
- ELT
